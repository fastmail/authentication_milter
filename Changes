  - Optimizations and efficiency improvements

3.20241011 2024-10-11 15:06:59+11:00 Australia/Melbourne
  - DMARC: Add HBL address style report suppression
           New config item: report_suppression_email_list

3.20240827 2024-08-27 10:35:56+10:00 Australia/Melbourne
  - Core: Make the DNS Timeouts caching configurable
          Thanks to Jedrzej Jajor (@jedrzejj)
          Adds a config option (cache_dns_timeouts) to allow disabling the
          caching of domains which timed out during a DNS query. By default
          the option is enabled to preserve the current behaviour. Setting
          the option to 0 disables the cache and the query will be sent to the
          DNS resolver each time regardless of previous timeouts.
  - ARC: Fix bug in ARC use of DKIM identity where no DKIM domain exists
  - Core: Skip addresses with more than 1 @ as bogus
  - Core: Don't override log_dispatchouli's configuration default values
          Thanks to: Norikatsu Shigemura (@nanorkyo)

3.20240701 2024-07-01 14:10:31+10:00 Australia/Melbourne
  - DMARC: New option to enable strict processing of rfc5322 from domains.
           Adds the strict_multifrom config item to DMARC (default false).
           If set, the handler will reject/quarantine messages where
           multiple rfc5322 from domains are present.
           DMARC processing/reporting will continue as usual as defined by
           the *_on_multifrom settings, however any dispositions will
           be overridden to reject or quarantine depending on the value set
           for hard_reject.
  - ARC/DMARC: Override DMARC enforcement when the trusted ARC chain has
               a passing DMARC entry.
               This improves the case where an ARC trusted forwarder has broken
               authentication without leaving enough SPF/DKIM indicators in the
               AAR for us to process, OR has modified the RFC5322 From domain as
               is the case with certain privacy focussed bi-directional
               forwarding services

3.20240618 2024-06-18 17:18:47+10:00 Australia/Melbourne

          required to 1.01
  - SPF: Add option to detect and optionally mitigate SPF upgrade problems.

          which can be used to process ARex JSON log format back into

3.20230629 2023-06-29 23:44:32+00:00 UTC
  - DKIM: Prepare for Ed25519 support in Mail::DKIM
